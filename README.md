### RAG-Techniques
Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) and RAG-like Search Techniques: A Comprehensive Overview
Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is revolutionizing how large language models (LLMs) interact with information, combining the power of LLMs with the ability to access and retrieve real-time data from external sources. This synergy allows LLMs to generate more accurate, relevant, and comprehensive responses, especially for knowledge-intensive tasks. This article offers a detailed exploration of various RAG and RAG-like search techniques,  present them in a comprehensive table format.

# Understanding the Core Concepts of RAG
Before delving into the specific techniques, let's establish a foundational understanding of the core components of a RAG system:

# Knowledge Base: 
This is the source of information that the RAG system will access. It can be a structured database, a collection of documents, or any other repository of knowledge.
Retrieval System: This component is responsible for retrieving relevant information from the knowledge base based on a user's query. It often involves techniques like semantic search or keyword-based search.
Generative Model: This is typically an LLM that uses the retrieved information to generate a response.
Techniques for Enhancing RAG Systems
RAG systems can be enhanced through various techniques applied at different stages of the retrieval and generation process. These techniques aim to improve the accuracy, efficiency, and relevance of the system's responses.

# Pre-Retrieval Techniques
These techniques focus on optimizing the knowledge base and the retrieval process before the actual retrieval happens.

# Chunking:
Dividing large texts into smaller, manageable units to improve retrieval accuracy and efficiency. This is essential because embedding models and language models have context length limitations .
# Indexing: 
Organizing and structuring the knowledge base to facilitate efficient retrieval .
# Metadata Filtering: 
Using metadata, such as timestamps or categories, to narrow down the search space and improve retrieval accuracy. For example, if a user asks about "recent advancements in AI," you could filter for chunks dated within the last year .
# Hypothetical Question Indexing: 
Generating hypothetical questions for each chunk of data and using them to match user queries. This technique involves using an LLM to generate one or more questions for each data chunk stored in the database. These questions can later be used to inform the retrieval step .
# Query Expansion: 
Enhancing the user's query with related terms or synonyms to improve retrieval accuracy. This can be very helpful for retrieving context when the embedding doesn't contain all the required information .
# Query Rewriting: 
Restructuring the user's query to improve its clarity and effectiveness for retrieval. This technique restructures the user's query into a format that is more understandable by the LLM and usable by retrievers .
# Query Decomposition: 
Breaking down complex queries into smaller, more manageable sub-queries. When a query arrives, similar data chunks are retrieved and combined to generate a response .
# Self-Query Retrieval: 
Allowing the LLM to generate follow-up queries to refine the retrieval process. This technique involves the language model (LLM) generating follow-up queries based on the initial user query to retrieve more precise information .
# Parent-child retrieval: 
This technique involves structuring documents into smaller segments, known as "child chunks," while maintaining references to their original, larger "parent" documents. During retrieval, the system first identifies relevant child chunks based on a user's query and then retrieves the corresponding parent documents to provide comprehensive context .
